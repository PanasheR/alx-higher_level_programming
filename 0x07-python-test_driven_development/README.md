# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

Python Test Cases:

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files should end with a new line
    All your test files should be inside a folder tests
    All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
    All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
    All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
    All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
    A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
    We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case – The Checker is checking for tests!
